Write a C++ program which receives a file name as command line argument.
It then reads all the lines of text in the input file, and prints out the longest line in the file. 
If there are multiple lines of the same length, the first longest line should be returned. 
Your program should have one single line of output, which is the longest line in the file. 
If the input file is empty then your program should not print anything.
